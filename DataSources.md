Please note that for performance reasons, exchange rates from XE.com and results from the API (https://olib.uk) relating to 
charities/classifications have been cached as Excel files which are included as part of this repository. To change the source of the files
to your own local folder, download Power BI desktop (https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/), open the PBIX file in this
repository, click on 'Edit Queries' and update the source step of each relevant query. Alternatively the queries which point directly
to the API/to XE.com are contained within this file and can be leveraged instead.
